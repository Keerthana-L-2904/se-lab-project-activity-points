# Ignore all findings in README.md and backend/.env

# Use proper fingerprints OR regex-based path ignore
# Since your leak is "backend/.env:generic-api-key:1", this line matches it exactly:
backend/.env:generic-api-key:1

# Or if you want to ignore all leaks in that file:
path:backend/.env

# You can also use this to ignore README.md entirely:
path:README.md
